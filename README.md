## 💬 The Idea Behind BaseFrame  

Every design starts with a blank page — BaseFrame is that page.  
It doesn’t tell you where to place your elements or how your layout should behave.  
Instead, it gives you the building blocks to paint your vision: color by color, layer by layer, effect by effect.  

It’s CSS without the weight — a quiet helper that stays out of your way while you build something great.  

## 🪶 Philosophy  

**Keep it light. Keep it clear. Keep it yours.**  

BaseFrame believes that simplicity is power.  
No preprocessors, no hidden logic — just clean, honest CSS utilities that work everywhere.  
You decide the story. BaseFrame just provides the words.
